# Milestone 4 project - Slovak shop

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a marketplace for Slovak products to be sold to residents in the UK. 

## User stories

## Design

I designed the site to use fairly neutral colours (with a blue pop of colour) to emulate the more country living feeling that Slovak food evokes in me. The colour scheme can be seen below with hex codes:

The font used is Lexend, as it is a dyslexia friendly font, which means a wider audience can find it easier to navigate the site. The font was sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend?query=lexend).

## Wireframes

Using the design elements, I combined them to keep the site incredibly simple and easy to view for most visitors.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

python3 manage.py runserver
