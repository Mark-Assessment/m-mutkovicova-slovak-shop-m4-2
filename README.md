## Design

I designed the site to use fairly neutral colours (with a blue pop of colour) to emulate the more country living feeling that Slovak food evokes in me. The colour scheme can be seen below with hex codes:

The font used is Lexend, as it is a dyslexia friendly font, which means a wider audience can find it easier to navigate the site. The font was sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend?query=lexend).

### Wireframes

Using the design elements, I combined them to keep the site incredibly simple and easy to view for most visitors.

## Acknowledgments

This project is a very close replica of the Boutique Ado project from Code Institute. While I have put my stamp on design, interaction and extension choices, I have followed the main logic of e-commerce site from the walkthrough.

## Thank you

Rachel from EKC Group - thank you for your unwavering support of my many times in giving up and for providing us with a supportive environment to complete our project.

Ariela - Without you, I literally would never have completed this course. Thank you so much for supporting me, making me feel smarter than I am, and helping me to see a potential career.

Alex - I know there are many days where I abandoned you in favour of coding. Thank you for being supportive and reminding me every day that I am doing this to give us all a better life, not just me.

James - For coming into my life and giving me that lightbulb moment that made me think about pursuing that thing I've always wanted to do. You may have made life 10x harder, but you've also made it much clearer.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.
